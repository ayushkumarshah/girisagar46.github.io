Summary: The contents that you are seeing right now is the static website built using Pelican. This tutorial series gives you every details on how to create a static blog using pelican and host it to the github server for FREE!

> For this tutorial series, I'm assuming that you are working in a Linux environment. If not, you can use [virtualenv] for Windows or Mac.

# Getting started

First the big question, "What is [Pelican]?"

In short, Pelican is a static site generator that supports Markdown and reST syntax. Powered by Python. For more visit, [getpelican.com](http://getpelican.com/)

For this tutorial, you only need to understand basic Git push/pull and branching command and as well as some basic [Markdown] syntax. If you are a noob, no worries I'll cover each and every topics in detail.

## Prerequisits:

* [Install Git VCS]
* [Install Python]
* [Install Markdown]
* [Setup Github account]
* [Setup github.io]
* [A code editor]

## Setup Github page
First you need to have a [github.io][Setup github.io] page. Noew, clone your github.io repository and `cd` into it.

    $ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
    $ cd username.github.io/

Create a new Git branch called `source` or your any custom name. This new branch only holds your source code. The HTML generated by Pelican will be pushed to master branch which are then rendered in the website. We'll do Git push shortly. But, first let's create a new branch.
    
    $ git checkout -b source
    
Push the new branch on Github:

    $ git push origin source

You are now working on the `source` branch.

## Setup Pelican
Let's start with installing Pelican at the first place. Pelican, Pelican-Plugins and Pelican-Themes are dependent on different python modules and installing them one by one is a pain in the butt. Hence, for the simplicity, create a new file called `requirements.txt`. 

Open `requirements.txt` file in a `notepad` or `gedit` and paste the lines given below and save it.

    appdirs==1.4.0
    beautifulsoup4==4.5.1
    blinker==1.4
    bs4==0.0.1
    docutils==0.12
    ecdsa==0.13
    Fabric==1.12.0
    feedgenerator==1.9
    ghp-import==0.4.1
    Jinja2==2.8
    Markdown==2.6.7
    MarkupSafe==0.23
    packaging==16.8
    paramiko==1.17.2
    pelican==3.6.3
    pycrypto==2.6.1
    Pygments==2.1.3
    pyparsing==2.1.10
    python-dateutil==2.5.3
    pytz==2016.7
    six==1.10.0
    Unidecode==0.4.19

These are the modules that we need to get started with the Pelican static website generation.

To install the modules which are inside `requirements.txt`, type the following command in the terminal.
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't know what is pip and how to install it, go [here].

Upto this step you've setup a github.io blog and installed Pelican and it's dependencies.

## Pelican Quick Start

After installing pelican, you can leverage the command `$ pelican-quickstart` from the command line.

### Quick Setup

1. `cd` into your `username.github.io` repository that you cloned earlier.
    `$ cd username.github.io`
1.  Save this [.gitignore] file in your directory. It's needed to make your Github repo clean.
1.  Run `$ pelican-quickstart` in the terminal

The quickstart will ask you various questions, which you can answer in turn. Here are some specific answers you should give:

    > Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] (hit enter)
    > What will be the title of this web site? My Awesome Blog
    > Who will be the author of this web site? (Your Full Name)
    > What will be the default language of this web site? [en] (hit enter) 
    > Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., http://example.com   (Y/n) Y
    > What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) http://your_username.github.io
    > Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) Y
    > How many articles per page do you want? [10] 10
    > What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] Asia/Kathmandu
    > Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) Y
    > Do you want an auto-reload & simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? (Y/n) Y
    > Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) N
    > Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) N
    > Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) N
    > Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) N
    > Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) N
    > Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) Y
    > Is this your personal page (username.github.io)? (y/N) Y
    Done. Your new project is available at /<path>/your_username.github.io

That's it. Now you have the basic structure of your Pelican blog. The tree structure of the pelican blog is:

    .
    ├── content
    ├── develop_server.sh
    ├── fabfile.py
    ├── Makefile
    ├── output
    ├── pelicanconf.py
    └── publishconf.py
    
    2 directories, 5 files

Here, each files and folder have a specefic meaning. I'll discuss more on it later. 

### Build and serve

Generate HTML. All HTML files are generated in the `output` directory.

    $ fab build

Here `fab` is a build tool that comes with `Fabric` module. Now, serve the HTML.

    $ fab serve

And redirect your browser to `http://localhost:8000`. You'll see the result.

** Note: The website generated is only visible in local environment. We haven't pushed anything to Github yet. It'll be done after all configurations have been setup correctly.**

Now, just sitback, relax and observe every files inside the directory. If you understood nothing, maybe learn some [Markdown].

In [Part 2] we'll write our first blog post, configure and fabricate pelican, and our first commit to the github.
