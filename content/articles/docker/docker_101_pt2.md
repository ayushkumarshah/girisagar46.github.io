Summary: The [Part 1](https://girisagar46.github.io/docker-101) of this Docker tutorial covers the installation process of Docker in the Linux machine. In this Part 2, we'll dive little bit deeper into the docker world.

## WTF is a container and how does it differ from Virtual Machine?

In simple layman language, VM breaks the system resources into small chunks of independent OS or System. This breaking of your system hardware resources into small chunks is done by the Hypervisor. These independent systems have their own Memory, CPU's, Disk Storage, Network Interface and pretty much everything that an OS needs. It's your another full fledged virtual laptop.
