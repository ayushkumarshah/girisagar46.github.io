I was going through Quora feeds and my eye caught one particular question, "What are the top websites computer science students must visit?" This question had more than 3k followers. I immediately opened the question link and bookmarked it. 

Different users had given many answers and some of the links that I really liked are as follows:

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/#electrical-engineering-and-computer-science)

Many of the links that are mentioned above are releated to programming but, Computer Science is not only about coding/programming.
A competent computer science students should be able to design new algorithms, reduce complexity of the problem set and algorithms, or design a new programming language, implement a compiler or an intepreter, etc. But, without strong knowledge of programming, nothing is possible.

If you have some cool links, do share it in the comment section below. :)
