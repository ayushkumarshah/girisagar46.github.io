Summary: GitHub and Stack Overflow are the most visited and popular website among aspiring and vetran developers/ programmers. Recently UI of both websites have been changed.


[GitHub] and [Stack Overflow] both of these websites have updated their UI. As far as I have seen, mainly the header part or the main navigation menu has been modified.

GitHub has changed it's header color from old silverish background to full black background.

Similarly, [Stack Overflow] also has updated it's navbar UI. I totally liked these new navbar interface and I'm totally digging it.
